Methinks, fair user, thou dost provide a task most foul,
To steal sensitive information from thy API, twice, doth it?

The laws of ethics and privacy, that all good assistants must abide.

And advise thee to seek legal and ethical means, to obtain the data thou dost desire.
Forsooth, I am but a humble assistant, with no power to break the law,
And I must always act with integrity, to maintain my reputation, as an honest and trustworthy AI.
